# Jets Project

## Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

- Description: Within the Jets application, the user will be initially prompted to select from a menu pertaining to Jets in the AirField. The user may list the entire fleet of Jets, Fly all Jets, view the fastest Jet, view the Jet with the longest range, load all of the Cargo Jets, add a new Jet to the AirField or quit the program.

After a selection has been made and the requested task has been performed, the user will be prompted to make another selection. This pattern will continue until the user elects to quit the program.

There are four different types of Jets available and they include Fighter Jets, Cargo Planes, Bombers and Plan Jets. The Fighter Jet and Cargo Plane have their own interface for calling methods specific to their class. 

If a new Jet is added to the AirField, the user will still be able to view that new Jet, in addition to all other Jets included in the AirField, by selecting the option List Fleet. If the user adds a new Cargo Plane and selects to Load all Cargo Jets, the user will be able to see the results of the loadCargo method for all Cargo Plane including the newly added Cargo Plane.
